            <p id="bio">Hi everyone! My name is Rory and I'm currently starting my new life as a software developer. My toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, Python, Node.js, MySQL, and MongoDB. My favorite language is C#, although I can't really tell you why. I enjoy making games through Unity as a hobby.</p>
